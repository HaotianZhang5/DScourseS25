\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Thera Bank aims to convert deposit customers into personal loan customers.
  \item Personal loans improve profitability compared to deposits.
  \item Predictive modeling can optimize customer targeting and marketing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data Collection and Description}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dataset: 5,000 Thera Bank customers (4373 after clean).
  \item Variables: Age, Income, Family, Credit Card Average Spending (CCAvg), Education, CD Account, etc.
  \item Removed Experience due to high correlation with Age.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Personal Loan Distribution. (Only ~10\% of customers accepted a loan.)
  \item Income-based segmentation: \textbf{No low-income} customers accepted loans.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Model Selection:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression}: Chosen for transparency, interpretability, and strong performance in structured financial datasets.
    \item \textbf{Tree Model}: Selected for rule-based segmentation and easy interpretation of customer groups.
    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)}: Rejected due to scalability issues, preprocessing needs, and lack of explainability.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Model Building:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic regression: Specified a logistic regression model with a small L1 penalty (0.01) to approximate ordinary logistic regression, setting the mixing parameter to 1 for pure lasso regularization.
    \item Tree model: Set the cost\_complexity to 0.001 to balance depth and overfitting, while retaining the default settings for min\_n and tree\_depth for potential future adjustment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Findings: Logistic Regression}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Significant predictors: Income, Family size, CCAvg, Education, CD Account.
  \item Higher income and graduate education increase likelihood.
  \item Online banking and Credit Card ownership negatively associated.
  \item Logistic Regression Accuracy: 95.05\%

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Findings: Tree Model}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Key splits: Income, CCAvg, CD Account, Education.
  \item Clear rule-based segmentation.
  \item Tree Model Accuracy: 98.02\%

\frametitle{Conclusion and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Predictive models help the bank identify target customers and adjust marketing strategies.
  \item People with the following features are more likely to buy personal loans:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Higher income
    \item Larger family size
    \item Higher spending on credit cards
    \item Higher level of education (graduate or advanced degree)
    \item Certificate of deposit (CD) account ownership
  \end{itemize}
  \item Improve personal loan conversion rates, optimize resource allocation, and increase bank profitability.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{How Did AI Contribute to This Research?}
\small
This research utilized AI, specifically ChatGPT 4o, for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Code development and troubleshooting in RStudio and LaTeX.
  \item Internet searches for academic research\footnote{All AI-found research was verified for accuracy by the researcher.}.
  \item Advice on methodologies and argument structures.
  \item Assisting in basic mathematics and data cleaning tasks.
\end{itemize}

The use of AI is equated to any other research tool, ensuring the paper's academic integrity. Critical intellectual processes were conducted by the human research team.
