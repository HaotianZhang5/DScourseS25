\section{Interesting data} 
I'm interested in the data that could tell a story about the economic phenomenon "Guzi 
Economy" in China. But it looks like the data is hard to collect. In this kind of situation, I will prefer to select some interesting data in 
Sports. Like, NBA triple-double rankings or Real Madrid's all-time scoring list. 

\section{Answer to the previous question} 
6.7- df1 is a local tibble. df is a Spark dataframe. 
6.8- Column names should remain the same. However, Spark sometimes converts names to lowercase and 
replaces spaces with underscores.
