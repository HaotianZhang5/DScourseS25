1 Interesting data I‚Äôm interested 
in the data that could tell a story about the economic phenomenon ÄùGuzi 
Economy‚Äù in China. But it looks like the data is hard to collect. In 
this kind of situation, I will prefer to select some interesting data in 
Sports. Like, NBA triple-double rankings or Real Madrid‚Äôs all-time 
scoring list. 

2 Answer to the previous question 6.7- df1 is a local 
tibble. df is a Spark dataframe. 6.8- Column names should remain the 
same. However, Spark sometimes
converts names to lowercase and replaces spaces with underscores.
